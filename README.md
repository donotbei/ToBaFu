ToBaFu: Topology-Based Fusion Model for Classification of Two-dimensional Cancer Images

## Dataset Description

Datasets:
The CRC-5000 dataset. 
The public dataset is available at  https://zenodo.org/records/53169. 
It contains 5000 colorectal cancer histological images and 8 different tissue classes (TUMOR, STROMA, COMPLEX, LYMPHO, DEBRIS, MUCOSA, ADIPOSE, EMPTY), every class comprises 625 images and each image is saved in *.tif format.

The BUS-250 dataset. 
The public dataset can be accessed at https://zenodo.org/records/53169. 
It comprises 250 grayscale breast ultrasound images, including 100 benign samples and 150 malignant samples.
Images are stored in *.bmp format. 
Given different pixel sizes of the images—ranging from a minimum of 93 × 57 to a maximum of 199 × 161, we resize each original image size to 100 × 75.
